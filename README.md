# Fear Facers
## Allison Lee, Elisa Truong, William Kwok, James Kim

Our idea sparks from a one week OCD/anxiety therapy camp hosted by the University of Florida. The New York Times presented a story of a young girl who had OCD and was extremely afraid of getting sick, throwing up, and tornadoes. The camp would slowly immerse her into those uncomfortable situations. This type of cognitive-behavioral therapy is shown to reduce symptoms by at least 50 percent. It's an immersion, exposure of fear in increments. There is existing virtual reality immersion therapy, but we wanted to take a step further and build an augmented reality therapy. We want therapists to have a more accessible way of administrating safer cognitive-behavioral treatment.
